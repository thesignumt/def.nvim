# def.nvim

def.nvim is a lightweight Neovim plugin for quickly looking up word definitions, examples, synonyms, and antonyms directly in a floating window. It supports word history, favorites, random word exploration, and integrates with Telescope for a smoother experience.

this plugin was made for my neovim config.. so there are probably bigger, better, actively maintained plugins than this.

})
```

These are the default configuration options.
